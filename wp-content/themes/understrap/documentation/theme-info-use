The Second part of this guide describes how to update understap theme. When first installing Understap theme, make sure that you don’t make any changes in the files. If you have, and you don`t want to lose them, the best way save them is to use a freeware tool for comparing files, Beyond Compare for example (How to use it can be found on their website). After comparing files, you can then upload only those files that haven’t been changed.
If you haven`t changed any theme files, all you need to do to update your current version is to download the latest package from ThemeForest, unpack the files, and upload the new files on the server while replacing the old files by overwriting them.
All your data is safe because theme file updates do not change anything in the database. It is still recommended to always make a backup of your files & database.
